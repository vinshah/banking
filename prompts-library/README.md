Use appropriate prompt to and then there are additional options for what tools like Claud/ChatGPT/Gemini can do with your PlantUML code:

1. Documentation & Descriptions

Convert to written process documentation (step-by-step guide)
Create a narrative description of the workflow
Generate API documentation from the endpoints shown
Write technical specifications based on the flow

2. Visual Alternatives

Create a Mermaid diagram (similar to PlantUML, renders in markdown)
Generate an HTML/React interactive diagram (clickable, zoomable)
Create an SVG diagram using D3.js or similar
Build a flowchart version (different visualization style)

3. Code & Implementation

Generate API interface definitions (OpenAPI/Swagger specs)
Create code stubs for the services shown (Java, Python, etc.)
Build integration test scenarios based on the flow
Generate mock API responses for each endpoint

4. Analysis & Design Documents

Create a data flow diagram
Generate a system architecture document
Build a requirements specification
Create an integration design document

5. Different Diagram Types

Component diagram (showing system components and relationships)
Deployment diagram (showing how services are deployed)
State diagram (showing loan application states)
Activity diagram (more detailed business process view)

6. Presentation Materials

Create a PowerPoint presentation explaining the flow
Generate training materials for the system
Build stakeholder documentation (non-technical version)
